The Central GroundWater Board has upwards of 40,000 groundwater monitoring stations across the country Much of their data on groundwater levels is accessible via INDIA WRIS this repo contains code and jupyter notebooks to explore and visualize these datasets and compare them with each other

#Datasets

via Tejasvi Hora, U Waterloo by email from CGWB this dataset contains state, district, lat, long, site type, well code and Quarterly water level data from 1996 until 2017
via INDIA WRIS by selecting Application: Groundwater ; Report Type: State wise Station Level Report (2020-Apr-03) this dataset contains state, district, station (name), lat, long, station type and monthly/annual groundwater level data (last one to be verified)
via INDIA WRIS by pinging the INDIA WRIS geoserver with a WFS request (2020-Apr-03) this dataset is a shapefile with the locations of all groundwater monitoring stations in the country
#Vision for this project

compare the various datasets available and document metadata for each
create some map layers using the raw groundwater level data available
scraper to download CGWB data for any state and any time period necessary




1. Central Ground Water Board has 16 Regional Chemical Laboratories to carry out chemical analysis of water samples. The Chemical laboratories are well equipped with sophisticated instruments like ICP-MS, Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) etc. Ground water sampling for quality monitoring is done once a year during the premonsoon period. In addition to it ground water samples are also collected and analysed as a part of other scientific studies.
