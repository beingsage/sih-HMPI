pollution in groundwater using mathematical formulas and computational
methods. The system supports **60 different elements** across 5 priority
groups and integrates standards from major international organizations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. ALL FORMULAS IMPLEMENTED

### 1.1 Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI)

**Formula:** HPI = Σ(Wi × Qi) / ΣWi\
**Where:** Qi = ((Mi - Ii) / (Si - Ii)) × 100

**Variables:** - Mi = Measured concentration of ith metal (mg/L) - Ii =
Ideal value (usually 0 or natural background) - Si = Standard
permissible value (regulatory limit) - Wi = Unit weight for ith metal
(based on toxicity) - n = Number of metals analyzed

**Interpretation:** - HPI \< 25: Excellent - 25 ≤ HPI \< 50: Good - 50 ≤
HPI \< 75: Poor - 75 ≤ HPI \< 100: Very Poor - HPI ≥ 100: Unsuitable

### 1.2 Heavy Metal Evaluation Index (HEI)

**Formula:** HEI = Σ(Hci / Hmaci)

**Variables:** - Hci = Measured concentration of ith heavy metal
(mg/L) - Hmaci = Maximum allowable concentration (regulatory limit)

**Interpretation:** - HEI \< 40: Low pollution - 40 ≤ HEI ≤ 80: Medium
pollution - HEI \> 80: High pollution

### 1.3 Contamination Degree (Cd) & Modified Contamination Degree (mCd)

**Formulas:** - Cd = Σ CFi - mCd = (Σ CFi) / n - CFi = C_sample /
C_background

**Variables:** - CFi = Contamination Factor for ith pollutant - C_sample
= Measured concentration in sample - C_background = Natural background
concentration - n = Total number of pollutants

**Interpretation (mCd):** - mCd \< 1.5: Nil to very low contamination -
1.5 ≤ mCd \< 2: Low contamination - 2 ≤ mCd \< 4: Moderate
contamination - 4 ≤ mCd \< 8: High contamination - mCd ≥ 8: Very high
contamination

### 1.4 Pollution Load Index (PLI)

**Formula:** PLI = (CF1 × CF2 × CF3 × ... × CFn)\^(1/n)

**Variables:** - CFi = Contamination Factor = C_sample / C_background -
n = Number of metals

**Interpretation:** - PLI \< 1: No pollution - PLI ≥ 1: Pollution
present

### 1.5 Metal Index (MI)

**Formula:** MI = Σ(Ci / MACi)

**Variables:** - Ci = Concentration of ith metal in sample - MACi =
Maximum Allowable Concentration for ith metal

**Interpretation:** - MI \< 0.3: Excellent water quality - 0.3 ≤ MI \<
1.0: Good water quality - 1.0 ≤ MI \< 3.0: Poor water quality - MI ≥
3.0: Unsuitable for drinking

### 1.6 Enrichment Factor (EF)

**Formula:** EF = (Ci / Cref)\_sample / (Ci / Cref)\_background

**Variables:** - Ci = Concentration of element of interest - Cref =
Concentration of reference element (usually Fe or Al)

**Interpretation:** - EF \< 2: Minimal enrichment - 2 ≤ EF \< 5:
Moderate enrichment - 5 ≤ EF \< 20: Significant enrichment - 20 ≤ EF \<
40: Very high enrichment - EF ≥ 40: Extremely high enrichment

### 1.7 Geo-accumulation Index (Igeo)

**Formula:** Igeo = log2(Cn / (1.5 × Bn))

**Variables:** - Cn = Measured concentration in sample - Bn =
Geochemical background concentration - 1.5 = Background matrix
correction factor

**Interpretation:** - Igeo ≤ 0: Practically uncontaminated - 0 \< Igeo ≤
1: Uncontaminated to moderately contaminated - 1 \< Igeo ≤ 2: Moderately
contaminated - 2 \< Igeo ≤ 3: Moderately to heavily contaminated - 3 \<
Igeo ≤ 4: Heavily contaminated - 4 \< Igeo ≤ 5: Heavily to extremely
contaminated - Igeo \> 5: Extremely contaminated
